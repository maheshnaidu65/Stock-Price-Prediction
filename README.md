# Stock-Price-Prediction using LSTM (Recurrent Neural Networks)

The program takes at a time, stock price values of 60 days as input to predict its value on the 61st day.

A vector containing 60 stock price values is given as input to a LSTM network. Optimized and checked that 60 sequential values best predicted the output.

Predicted future opening and closing prices with 11% rms error. (The program performs prediction for closing price )

Plotted and observed that the predicted stock prices closely follow th actual process
